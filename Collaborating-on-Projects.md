# Basics of Collaborating on Projects

Collaboration is the heart of software development. At THD/DIT, as you immerse yourself in the world of Artificial Intelligence Engineering, you'll find that team projects, group assignments, and collaborative research are a norm. This guide aims to introduce you to the essentials of teaming up with others on GitHub.

## Introduction

- **Why collaborate on GitHub?** 🤔
  - GitHub provides tools that make team collaboration easy and efficient. Imagine working on a group assignment where everyone can contribute simultaneously without overwriting each other's work. That's the magic of GitHub!

## Branches 🌲

1. **What are branches?**
   - Think of branches as individual workspaces within a repository. It allows multiple people to work on different parts of a project without affecting the main (or "master") version.

2. **How and why to create a branch:** 
   - When you want to add a feature or fix a bug, you create a branch, which is a copy of the main code. This keeps the main codebase stable while you make your changes.

3. **Merging branches:** 🔄
   - Once your work on a branch is complete, you combine (or "merge") it with the main branch, incorporating your changes into the main project.

## Pull Requests 📥

1. **What's a pull request?**
   - It's a proposal to merge your branch into the main branch. It allows others to review your changes before they become official.

2. **How to create one:** 
   - After pushing your branch to GitHub, you'll see an option to create a pull request. Fill in the details, and you're set!

3. **Reviewing & merging pull requests:** ✅
   - Team members can review the proposed changes, leave comments, or suggestions. Once everything looks good, the pull request is merged, making your changes part of the main project.

## Projects 📋

1. **What are GitHub Projects?**
   - They are like Trello boards inside GitHub. They help teams organize tasks, to-dos, and timelines.

2. **How and why to use GitHub Projects:** 
   - Create columns for tasks like "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done". You can drag and drop tasks as they progress. It's great for keeping everyone in the loop and managing project progress.

3. **Collaborate on Projects as a group:** 🤝
   - Team members can add tasks, assign them to others, and set deadlines. It's an interactive way to ensure everyone knows their responsibilities.

## Working Together 🌐

1. **Leaving and addressing comments:** 💬
   - Constructive feedback helps improve work. Leave comments on specific lines of code or general remarks about pull requests.

2. **Resolving conflicts when multiple people make changes:** ❗
   - Sometimes, two people might unknowingly edit the same part of a file. GitHub will highlight these "conflicts", and they'll need to be resolved before merging.
