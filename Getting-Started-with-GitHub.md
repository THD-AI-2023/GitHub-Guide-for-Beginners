# Getting Started with GitHub 🚀

Welcome to the world of collaborative software development! As budding Artificial Intelligence Engineers at THD/DIT, it's crucial to familiarize yourselves with tools that professionals use in real-world scenarios. This guide will introduce you to GitHub, a platform you'll use frequently throughout your academic and professional journey.

## Introduction 📘

- **What is GitHub? 🌐**
  - Think of GitHub as a platform that allows multiple people to work on the same project without stepping on each other's toes. It's like Google Docs for code!

- **The difference between Git and GitHub:**
  - **Git** is a version-control system that tracks changes in computer files. It's the underlying system that allows multiple people to work on the same project.
  - **GitHub** is a hosting service for Git repositories. It's a platform that uses Git in the background and adds some neat features on top, like a visual interface, collaboration tools, and more.

## Setting Up 🛠️

1. **Creating a GitHub account: 🆔**
   - Head over to [github.com](https://github.com/) and sign up. Use your university email for potential academic benefits!
  
2. **Basics of repositories: 📁**
   - Once you have an account, the main thing you'll interact with is called a repository (or repo for short). Think of it as a folder for your project. It contains all your project's files and tracks all changes.
   - Creating one is simple; just click the '+' icon on the top right corner after logging in.

3. **Cloning a repository: 🔄**
   - Cloning means getting a copy of a repo from GitHub down to your computer. This is useful because you can work on it locally, make changes, and then upload (or "push") those changes back to GitHub.

## Making Changes ✏️

1. **Editing files and understanding changes: 📑**
   - Once you've cloned a repo, any file you change or add will be tracked. GitHub will highlight these changes for you.

2. **Committing changes: 💾**
   - After making a change, you need to "commit" it. This is like saving a version of your work. Each commit has a message with it to describe what you did.

3. **Pushing changes: ⬆️**
   - Once you've committed your changes, you then "push" them to GitHub. This updates the online version of your repository with the changes you made locally.

## Beyond the Basics 🌟

1. **What's next? 🔍**
   - As you get more comfortable, you can start exploring advanced features of GitHub, like branches, pull requests, and more. These tools will become invaluable when working on team projects or larger assignments.
   
2. **The difference between GitHub and GitLab: 🤔**
   - Both GitHub and GitLab serve similar primary functions. They both utilize Git for version control and provide a platform for hosting repositories.
   - However, GitLab, which THD/DIT primarily uses, often includes built-in Continuous Integration/Delivery (CI/CD) tools and other features. It's worth noting that both platforms have their pros and cons, and while they're similar, there are differences in interface, workflow, and features. As part of your learning journey, it will be beneficial to understand the nuances of both!
